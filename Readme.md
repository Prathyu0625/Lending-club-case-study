# Lending Club Case Study

In this project, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Lending Club dataset to identify risky and profitable customers. Lending Club is a large online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing through an online platform. Our goal is to help the company make better decisions by analyzing customer data.

## General Information
- **Business Problem**: The purpose of this analysis is to help the Lending Club identify risky borrowers and profitable customers. By understanding the profile of these customers, Lending Club can improve loan approvals and minimize default risks.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for this analysis is the `loan.csv` file, which contains customer details, loan history, and other financial metrics.

## Conclusions
- loan amount and loan purposes significantly influence default rates.
- Loan amount and annual income are positively correlated; higher loans carry higher risk.
- Borrowers opting for longer loan terms (e.g., 60 months) have a higher likelihood of default.
- Critical factors such as annual income (`annual_inc`) and debt-to-income ratio (`dti`) provide valuable insights into repayment capability.

## Technologies Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library for creating plots.
- **Seaborn**: Advanced statistical visualizations.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.

## Acknowledgements
- The project was inspired by financial analysis use cases in the field of data science.
